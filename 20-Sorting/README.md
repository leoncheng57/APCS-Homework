Comparing speeds of sorting techniques
========================================

Insertion Sort
--------------
speed=n^2
countA= similar (ex.100)
countC= similar (ex.100)


Selection sort
--------------
speed=n^2
countA=constant (ex. 190)
countC=similar (ex. 90)



Bubble sort
-------------
speed = slowest
countA = similar (ex. 270)
countC = similar (ex. 490)
